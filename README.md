# âš¡ EV Charging Station CRM on Salesforce

## ðŸ“œ Problem Statement
As the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) increases, the lack of an integrated platform for managing charging stations creates challenges for both operators and users.

**Key Issues:**
- No real-time visibility of slot availability  
- Long waiting times and poor scheduling  
- Inefficient billing and payment tracking  
- No centralized record of maintenance and breakdowns  

This project proposes a **Salesforce-based CRM solution** to centralize EV charging station management, streamline operations, and provide an improved customer experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. **Manage Charging Slots** â€“ Real-time tracking of available, booked, and occupied slots.  
2. **Customer Management** â€“ Store EV user details, vehicle info, and booking history.  
3. **Booking & Scheduling** â€“ Enable customers to book slots in advance via a Salesforce Experience Cloud portal or mobile app.  
4. **Payment & Billing** â€“ Automate invoices, track payments, and manage subscriptions using Salesforce Billing.  
5. **Maintenance Management** â€“ Track station maintenance, breakdown reports, and technician assignments as Salesforce Cases.  
6. **Analytics & Reports** â€“ Dashboard for station performance, revenue, and energy usage with Salesforce Reports & Dashboards.  
7. **Notifications** â€“ Send SMS/email reminders using Salesforce Marketing Cloud or Flows.
